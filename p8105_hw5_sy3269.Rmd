## Problem 1

For n people in a room, we will check for any duplicate birthdays. Some of the assumptions we make are as follows: 

1) there are at least two people share the same birthday 
2) there are no leap years 
3) birthdays are uniformly distributed over the year 


```{r}
bday_sim = function(n) {

  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n

  return(duplicate)
  
}
```


If the simulation is ran 10,000 times for each group size between 2 and 50, we get the following function. 

```{r}
sim_res = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))
```


The probability that at least two people in the group share a birthday is averaged across the 10000 simulation runs and the probability as a function of group size was plotted. If we have about 23 people, there is a 0.5 probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday. 

```{r}
sim_res |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob )) + 
  geom_line()
```




## Problem 2

Setting n = 30, ($\sigma$) = 5, a normal distribution function is generated. Then, 5000 datasets where ($\mu$) = 0 were created using iteration. 

```{r}
sim_mean_sd = function(true_mu) {
  
  design = rnorm(n = 30, mean = true_mu, sd = 5)
  
  t_test_result = t.test(design, mu = true_mu, conf.level = 0.95)
  
  t_test_result |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  select(estimate, p.value)
}

sim_mean_sd(0)

sim_data = 
  expand_grid(
    mu = 0,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) |>
  mutate(result = map(mu, sim_mean_sd)) |>
  unnest(result) 
```


The same iteration using the same function was performed for ($\mu$) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} then a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of ($\mu$) on the x axis was made. 

```{r}
sim_result = 
  expand_grid(
    mu = c(0:6),
    iter = 1:5000
  ) |>
  mutate(result = map(mu, sim_mean_sd)) |>
  unnest(result) 
  
sim_result |>
  group_by(mu) |>
  summarize(prop = mean(p.value < 0.05)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = prop)) +
  geom_point()








  mutate(prop = ifelse(conclusion == "reject", iter/5000, 0)) |>
  filter(prop != 0) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = prop)) +
  geom_point()


  
```

Describe the association between effect size and power.


```{r}
sim_result |>
  filter(conclusion == "reject the null") |>
  group_by(mu) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = estimate)) +
    geom_point()

```


Make a plot showing the average estimate of 𝜇̂ on the y axis and the true value of 𝜇 on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of 𝜇̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of 𝜇 on the x axis. Is the sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇? Why or why not?





## Problem 3

The *Washington Post* has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. The raw data summarizes 52,179 homicide cases and there was a case with incorrect information. A case that occurred in Tulsa, with uid starting with `Tul` had state information classified as `AL` instead of `OK`. Since Tulsa is located in Oklahoma, the incorrect information was updated as shown below. 

Then, a new column with `city_state` information was added to the dataset. 

```{r}
homicide_data = read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(state = ifelse(city == "Tulsa" & state == "AL", "OK", state),
         city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "))

case_data = 
  homicide_data |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarize(
    total_cases = n(), 
    unsolved_cases = sum(disposition != "Closed by arrest")
  ) 
```


For the city of Baltimore, MD, `prop.test` was performed on the unsolved cases out of the total homicide cases. The estimate and confidence interval data was extracted from the `prop.test` results. 

```{r}
x = case_data |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  pull(unsolved_cases) 
  
n = case_data |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  pull(total_cases)
  
baltimore_prop = 
  prop.test(x, n) |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  select(estimate, conf.low:conf.high)
```


The above was made into a function. 

```{r}
city_state_prop = function(name) {
  
  x = case_data |>
    filter(city_state == name) |>
    pull(unsolved_cases) 
  
  n = case_data |>
    filter(city_state == name) |>
    pull(total_cases)
  
  prop.test(x, n) |>
    broom::tidy() |>
    select(estimate, conf.low:conf.high)
}

city_state_prop("Baltimore, MD")

```


To extract the proportion and confidence interval for each city, the following loop was done. 

```{r}
unique_city_state = 
  case_data |>
  distinct(city_state) |>
  pull(city_state)


city_state_sim = 
  tibble(
    unique_name = unique_city_state
  ) |>
  mutate(data = map(unique_name, city_state_prop)) |>
  unnest(data) |>
  janitor::clean_names() 
```


Then, a plot showing the estimates and CIs for each city was made. 

```{r}
city_state_sim |>
  mutate(unique_name = fct_reorder(unique_name, estimate)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = unique_name, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf_low, ymax = conf_high)) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "City, State", 
    y = "Estimate proportion and CI", 
    title = "Unsolved Homicides in the US Cities", 
    caption = "Data on homicides in 50 large US cities gathered by the Washington Post was used."
  )
```
